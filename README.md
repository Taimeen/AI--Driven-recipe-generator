# 🍽️ AI-Driven Recipe Generator

The **AI-Driven Recipe Generator** is an intelligent web application designed to help users create and explore cooking recipes using image-based or ingredient-based inputs. This system leverages AI and NLP techniques to generate context-aware recipes and instructions based on user interactions, such as uploading an image or typing ingredients.

## 🧑‍💻 About the Developer

This project was **entirely developed individually** by **Taimeen Bhanu Mulla** as a standalone AI-integrated web application.  
Responsibilities handled include:

- 💻 **Frontend Development**: Designed and developed the full user interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to support image upload and ingredient input.
- 🔍 **Backend Engineering**: Created the backend logic using Python/Flask (or another suitable framework) to process user input and generate recipes.
- 🤖 **AI & NLP Integration**: Trained and fine-tuned AI models for text generation and natural language understanding for recipe formation.
- 🧪 **Testing & Deployment**: Ensured seamless flow, tested cross-browser compatibility, and deployed the application locally (or optionally hosted online).

## 🧠 Key Features

- 📷 **Image Upload**: Upload a food image to generate a possible recipe.
- 🥘 **Smart Recipe Generation**: Uses NLP models to create detailed recipes based on ingredient input or image analysis.
- 📋 **Step-by-Step Instructions**: Generates a full cooking procedure including preparation, spices, timings, and serving suggestions.
- 📦 **Ingredient & Spice Detection**: Dynamically detects and lists necessary ingredients for the dish.
- 💡 **Tips and Variations**: Suggests alternatives and improvements such as vegan options, butter vs ghee, cream vs coconut milk, etc.

## 🧪 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Python with Flask / Node.js (as applicable)
- **AI/NLP**: Python (transformers, spaCy, NLTK or OpenAI APIs)
- **Libraries**: TensorFlow / OpenCV (for image handling), PIL (optional)
- **Data**: Custom-trained or pre-trained datasets of recipes and cooking instructions

---

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **User uploads an image** or types a list of ingredients.
2. The app processes the input using an AI/NLP model.
3. A full recipe is generated with:
   - Ingredients
   - Quantities
   - Preparation and cooking steps
   - Tips and serving suggestions
4. The recipe is displayed with options to copy, save, or modify.
